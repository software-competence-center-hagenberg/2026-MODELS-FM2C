uv tool install ddgs
```

Install Node.js dependencies for content extraction (run once):

```bash

## Search

```bash
~/.pi/agent/skills/web-search/search.js "query"                         # Basic search (5 results)
~/.pi/agent/skills/web-search/search.js "query" -n 10                   # More results
~/.pi/agent/skills/web-search/search.js "query" --content               # Include page content as markdown
~/.pi/agent/skills/web-search/search.js "query" -t w                    # Results from last week
~/.pi/agent/skills/web-search/search.js "query" -t m                    # Results from last month
~/.pi/agent/skills/web-search/search.js "query" -r es-es                # Results in Spanish
~/.pi/agent/skills/web-search/search.js "query" -b google               # Use Google backend
